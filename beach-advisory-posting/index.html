                        Should the water quality results from a beach site or other

                        Standards, a Public Beach Advisory, or "red flag" is posted in
                        social media, such as it is here on the DEQ website, and on the
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/cnmi.waters/?fref=ts">CNMI Waters Facebook
                            page</a>.

                    <p>
                        It is also emailed to various agencies and individuals who ask to
                        be on the email list, and faxed to local papers for publication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Red Flag placards are also posted on beach signs located at
                        Saipan's most frequented beaches.

                    <p>
                        If a <span class="fw-600">"red flag"</span> occurs in an area that
                        is highly used, like in front of hotels, WQS/NPS staff will go to
                        the beach that same day to resample the beach. This allows BECQ to
                        notify the public as soon as possible when potential pathogens are
                        no longer present and it is once again safe to recreate in these
                        waters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many of the selected beach sites have been monitored continuously
                        since the late 1980's. That is why some beach sites bare the name
                        of an old hotel that has since been renamed under new ownership.
                        The original site names are used to ensure that these sites remain
                        associated with historical data kept within the BECQ database and
                        in the US EPA databases, and US EPA BEACON website.

                    New beach advisory signs have been recently installed around the
                    island of Saipan to provide useful knowledge in relation to the
                    health of CNMI waters and surroundings. The beach signs display the
                    advisory written in commonly used languages such as English, Korean,
                    Japanese, and Chinese for better engagement, along with the beach
                    safety flags.

                            A green flag is posted when water quality sample results from a
                            recreational beach site do not exceed advisory levels and the
                            site is safe to swim or fish.

                        <p>
                            A red flag is posted when water quality sample from a
                            recreational beach site exceeds the advisory levels. It may be
                            unsafe to swim or fish in this area within 300 feet of the
                            posted signs, so we advise the public not to swim or fish in the
                            area for 48 hours at your own risk after posting the red flag.
                        </p>

                <p>
                    (Note that when bacteria levels go above the standards, it can be
                    unsafe to come into contact with those waters, so you can become
                    sick. If you touch the water, especially if the water gets in your
                    nose, mouth, ears, or cuts, it can cause rashes, skin infections,
                    gastrointestinal illness and respiratory illness).

                <p>
                    The designated beach advisory signs are currently located at
                    frequented beach access sites for fishing, swimming and recreational
                    uses where BECQ samples weekly. Here are the following site
                    installations from north to south you will see: Grotto, Tanapag
                    Meeting Hall, DPW Channel Bridge (Lower Base), Micro Beach,
                    Grandvrio Hotel, Garapan Fishing Base, Garapan Beach (13 Fishermen’s
                    Memorial), Civic Center Beach, Sugar Dock, CK District No. 2
                    Drain-(Aquarius Beach), and Kanoa Resort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beach flag advisories are posted on the signs, on social media
                    (Facebook and Instagram), aired in the news, and on the DEQ website.
