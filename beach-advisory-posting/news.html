                                        Up for a swim? What about a swim in a storm drain? Next
                                        time you head for the beach, think about this: all over
                                        our island, water flows from Mount Takpochau down into our
                                        storm drains, taking with it all the trash and pollution
                                        from our watersheds – all of it eventually ending up in
                                        the ocean where we swim and fish.
                                    </p>

                                        We are pleased to highlight the 2021 Storm Drain Murals
                                        all designed by our very own talented Kagman High School
                                        artists after the concluded project challenge in support
                                        of "Environmental Awareness" and "World Oceans" Month
                                        events. Entries were judged based on how effective the art
                                        draws public attention to the fact that storm drains lead
                                        to the ocean, and dumping in them is act of pollution.
