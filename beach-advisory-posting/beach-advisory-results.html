                    Should the water quality results from a beach site or other
                    monitored stream site exceed the CNMI Water Quality Microbial
                    Standards, a Public Beach Advisory, or "red flag" is posted in
                    social media, such as it is here on the DEQ website, and on the
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cnmi.waters/?fref=ts" target="_blank">CNMI Waters Facebook
                        page</a>. It is also emailed to various agencies and individuals who
                    <a href="mailto:waterqualityreport@becq.gov.mp?subject=Beach Advisory Email List sign up request">ask
                        to be on the email list</a>, and faxed to local papers for publication. Red Flag placards are
                    also posted on beach signs located at Saipan's most frequented
                    beaches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a "red flag" occurs in an area that is highly used, like in front
                    of hotels, WQS/NPS staff will go to the beach that same day to
                    resample the beach. This allows BECQ to notify the public as soon as
                    possible when potential pathogens are no longer present and it is
                    once again safe to recreate in these waters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the selected beach sites have been monitored continuously
                    since the late 1980's. That is why some beach sites bare the name of
                    an old hotel that has since been renamed under new ownership. The
                    original site names are used to ensure that these sites remain
                    associated with historical data kept within the BECQ database and in
                    the US EPA databases, and US EPA BEACON website. You can visit the
                    <a href="http://watersgeo.epa.gov/beacon2/" target="_blank">US EPA BEACON website</a>
                    to view historical information about your favorite beach site or you
                    can review the last two years of water quality information in the
                    biennial CNMI 305(b) and 303(d) Water Quality Assessment Integrated
